# Git Tutorials


## Git
The initial working version of Git's code was very simple, so much so that he finds it deserving of insult. An acronym for Global Information Tracker, at least when it works properly.
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. 
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

**Platform**

**OS  : Ubuntu** 

**Ubuntu** is the modern, open source operating system on Linux for the enterprise server, desktop, cloud, and IoT

**18.04 LTS**

The 'main' archive of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS will be supported for **5 years until April 2023**. Ubuntu 18.04 LTS will be supported for 5 years for Ubuntu Desktop, Ubuntu Server, and Ubuntu Core.

**20.04 LTS**

Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) **feels stable, cohesive, and familiar**, which is not surprising given the changes since the 18.04 release, such as the move to to newer versions of the Linux Kernel and Gnome. As a result, the user interface looks excellent and feels smoother in operation than the previous LTS version.

**GPU : Graphics processing unit**, a specialized processor originally designed to accelerate graphics rendering.

**NVIDIA:**   designs and sells **GPUs** for gaming and professional applications, as well as chip systems for use in vehicles, robotics, and other tools. Some of the company's biggest competitors include Intel Corp.

known for **developing integrated circuits**, which are used in everything from electronic game consoles to personal computers (PCs). The company is a leading manufacturer of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs)

**Javascript  ES5:** 

**Javascript :** 

JavaScript is a fun and flexible programming language. It’s one of the core technologies of web development and can be used on both the front-end and the back-end.

ECMA Script 2009 , aka ES5 was the first evision to Javascript.



•	Versatile and robust

•	Front-End friendly

•	Back-End friendly

•	Enables web applications

•	Game Development

**Node JS**

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

**V8** is the name of the JavaScript **engine** that powers Google Chrome. It's the thing that takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome.

It  is **used for server-side programming**, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was originally designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind. Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.

**C++**

C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and so on. C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.

**HTML 5**

HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and last major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium recommendation. 

` `It is a system that **allows the modification of the appearance of web pages**, as well as making adjustments to their appearance. It also used to structure and present content for the web.

CSS3 :

Cascading style sheet

CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2. 1. It brings a lot of new features and additions, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts.

WebGL:

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is the new standard for 3D graphics on the Web, It is designed for the purpose of rendering 2D graphics and interactive 3D graphics. It is derived from OpenGL's ES 2.0 library which is a low-level 3D API for phones and other mobile devices. WebGL provides similar functionality of ES 2.0 (Embedded Systems) and performs well on modern 3D graphics hardware.

It is a JavaScript API that can be used with HTML5. WebGL code is written within the <canvas> tag of HTML5. It is a specification that allows Internet browsers access to Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) on those computers where they were used.

Angular 10+

` `A CLI is used **whenever a large vocabulary of commands or queries**, coupled with a wide (or arbitrary) range of options, can be entered more rapidly as text than with a pure GUI. This is typically the case with operating system command shells.

**Vim**:  Vim is **a text editor that** is upwards compatible to Vi. It can be used to edit all kinds of plain text. ... There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line editing, filename completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc..

Vim is a highly configurable text editor built **to enable efficient text editing**. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems. Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE .

**GUI**: A graphics-based operating system interface that uses icons, menus and a mouse (to click on the icon or pull down the menus) to manage interaction with the system. Developed by Xerox, the GUI was popularized by the Apple Macintosh in the 1980s. 

This kind of **interface allows word processing or web design programs**, for example, to offer WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) options.
